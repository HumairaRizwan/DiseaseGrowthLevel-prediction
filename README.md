Disease outbreaks pose a significant threat to mushroom cultivation, leading to yield losses and economic
repercussions. Timely identification of favorable conditions for disease development within the casing layer and
growing room is crucial for implementing preventive measures. This implements machine learning
models that use the analysis of environmental conditions to determine the level of disease growth within
the casing layers.
